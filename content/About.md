Hi, my name is Martin Brochhaus.

I have been a full stack software developer since 1998 and am retired since 2024.

For the rest of my life, I will focus on the upbringing and homeschooling of my daughter, Leah.

In my spare time, I organize the monthly meetups for the [Python User Group Singapore](https://www.meetup.com/singapore-python-user-group/).

Sometimes I publish silly code on [Github](https://github.com/mbrochh).
